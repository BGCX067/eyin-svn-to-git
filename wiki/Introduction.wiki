=Introduction=
Eyin is a somewhat procedural framework that uses the infamous MVC design pattern.

=The MVC Pattern=
It's quite simple, and if you tried a php framework or two in the past you must know how it works:
  * *The Model* is in charge of database.
  * *The Views* are what we once called templates - i.e. the HTML. and
  * *The Controller* is the middleman who does all the work.

==The Model==
Eyin's Model system is a bit of ORM, I was told. Lets say that you have a table in the database called _people_. The class that will represant it will be called _People_, and it will resign in _APP/models/people.php_;
{{{
<?php

class People extends Model {
    public $columns = array(
        'name' => array('Name', 'required'),
        'age'  => array('Age', 'int', 'required')
    );
}
}}}
